# My_Developing_Data_Products_Assignment2

This repository is created to keep my peer-graded assignment for R Markdown Presentation. It includes an interactive Plotly plot using air quality data from a local CSV file and is presented in ioslides format with the creation date.

**About the Dataset**
This dataset includes air quality measurements of major pollutants such as CO, NOx, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, PM2.5, and PM10, along with weather indicators like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It visually represents the Air Quality Index (AQI) and is ideal for environmental monitoring, pollution prediction, and research. The Air Quality Data is sourced from Kaggle.
